## Final Project for Programming II

## **2. Multi-Database Local BLAST Classification Tool**

Build a tool that identifies unknown sequences by comparing them against multiple local BLAST databases.

##Core functionality:

- Create one or more local sequence databases.
- Accept a multi-sequence query file.
- Run each query sequence against **multiple target databases**.
- Identify and rank the best hit across all databases.
- Assign a likely identity or category to each query sequence.

The project should include a strategy to **measure classification accuracy** and discuss how performance changes with different databases or parameters.
